## ⚡ Performance

### **Optimization Techniques**
- ✅ Minimal external dependencies (only GSAP and Lenis via CDN)
- ✅ Optimized images (compressed JPG/PNG formats)
- ✅ CSS minification in production
- ✅ Lazy loading for images below the fold
- ✅ Efficient CSS selectors and specificity
- ✅ Hardware-accelerated animations (transform, opacity)

### **Lighthouse Scores** (Target)
- 🟢 Performance: 95+
- 🟢 Accessibility: 95+
- 🟢 Best Practices: 100
- 🟢 SEO: 100

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### **Visual Hierarchy**
- Clear typographic scale using `clamp()` for fluid typography
- Strategic use of white space and content grouping
- Consistent border-radius and shadow system

### **Color System**
```css
/* Dark Theme (Default) */
Background: #0a0a0a → #1a1a1a (gradient)
Text: #ffffff (primary), rgba(255,255,255,0.8) (secondary)
Accent: Linear gradients (#667eea → #764ba2)

/* Light Theme */
Background: #ffffff → #f5f7fb
Text: #0a0a0a (primary), #333333 (secondary)
Accent: Same gradients with adjusted opacity
```

### **Animation Principles**
- Smooth easing functions (ease-in-out, cubic-bezier)
- Purposeful motion that guides attention
- Reduced motion respect for accessibility
- Scroll-triggered reveals for engagement

### **Responsive Breakpoints**
```css
Mobile:  < 768px  (single column, stacked navigation)
Tablet:  768px+   (adaptive grid, visible navigation)
Desktop: 1400px+  (max-width constraint, optimal line length)
```
