            <h2 class="section-title fade-in">About Me</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="about-text-only fade-in-up">
            <p>I'm a Computer Science student at Appalachian State University graduating in May 2026, with a focus on machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. My long-term goal is to work in research-driven ML or ML engineering roles, where I can contribute to model development, experimentation, and the translation of research ideas into reliable systems.</p>
            
            <p>My primary interest lies in understanding how models learn representations—particularly through attention mechanisms—and how architectural and training decisions affect performance, generalization, and interpretability. I enjoy working close to the math and implementation, moving fluidly between theory, code, and experimental results.</p>
            
            <h3>Current Work</h3>
            
            <p>My main project is <strong>LexiMind</strong>, a custom multi-task Transformer-based NLP system built in PyTorch for abstractive summarization, emotion classification, and topic clustering over literary and news datasets. The system uses an encoder–decoder architecture with attention, supports user-controlled compression levels for summarization, and performs multi-label emotion classification alongside topic grouping.</p>
            
            <p>A key aspect of this project is experimentation. I study architectural tradeoffs, representation learning behavior, and training dynamics by iterating on model components and evaluating results empirically. I also focus on model interpretability, including attention weight visualization, to better understand how the system processes and prioritizes information.</p>
            
            <p>Alongside LexiMind, I've built additional ML and data-driven projects, including a Formula 1 race outcome predictor using classical ML methods and feature engineering, and PlayAxis, a data-intensive platform integrating multiple external APIs. These projects have strengthened my ability to reason about datasets, evaluation metrics, and real-world constraints.</p>
            
            <h3>Background & Learning Approach</h3>
            
            <p>I've completed advanced university coursework in applied machine learning, numerical methods, and systems-oriented classes, as well as the Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng. I regularly study foundational and modern ML literature, including transformer-based research, to inform both my understanding and implementation choices.</p>
            
            <p>I learn best by building: implementing models from scratch, validating ideas through experiments, and refining systems based on evidence rather than assumptions. I'm particularly interested in NLP, representation learning, and applied deep learning, and I enjoy explaining complex ideas clearly—whether through writing, diagrams, or code.</p>
            
            <h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>
            
            <p>I'm actively seeking ML Engineering or research-oriented Software Engineering roles where I can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contribute to model development and experimentation</li>
                <li>Work closely with experienced engineers and researchers</li>
                <li>Continue building a strong foundation in ML systems and applied research</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This site serves as a place to share my projects, technical writing, and ongoing work as I continue developing as a machine learning engineer.</p>
